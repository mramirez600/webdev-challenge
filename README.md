## What Did I Enjoy

> I have not used Laravel in a while so becoming more current by refreshing my skills is always a bonus. I ran into some roadbloacks in creating this which is really the only way you will grow. I attempted to use the Maatwebsite and Cyber-Duck packages to expidite development but unfortunately they were not compatible with the latest version of Laravel and created more issues than being helpful (my dev environment could be a possibility). Relying on packages just shows you at times that it may be best to stick with the vanilla programming language of your choice.
